                <h2>Text of the current Dörtstani constitution</h2>
                <h3>I-State's values and principles</h3>
                <p>1.The Republic of Dörtstan is a State whose primary vocation is to enable the happiness, freedom and equality of all its citizens and all people.</p>
                <p>2.All people enjoy the inalienable right to physiological needs, including sufficient nutrition, breathing equipment, proper hydration, shelter, and decent hygiene. This list may be extended by organic institutional law.</p>
                <p>3.The State guarantees all the rights, duties and powers defended in the present constitution, except those explicitly relegated to any other person, institution, group of people or organization.</p>
                <P>4.The state must use means proportionate to their benefits for Dörtinzi and global society. The security of the state can only be defended to the extent of the Republic's contributions.</P>
                <P>5.The common interest of society is more important than the one of any individual, but no individual shall be deprived of any of his fundamental rights, including the human rights of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognized by the state and those set forth in Article 2 of this constitution.</P>
                <P>6.Since notions such as conscience or sensibility are too complex to be formally expressed in this constitution, it is the organic law on ethics that will decide on its definition. The State can only act in the direct or indirect interest of things possessing any degree of conscience or sensitivity.</P>.
                <p>7.The State is separate from all religion, and favors none. The use of religion solely for political purposes is not prohibited. The use and practice of religion must be regulated by an organic law relating to religion.</p>
                <P>8.¹ the State recognizes all languages, and the practice of a language can only be prohibited by restrictions linked to freedom of expression and exhibition.
                    <br>² The languages of the State are French, English and Breton as defined in the most comprehensible way possible by the Language State Council, which means that all laws must be written in the standard language. All laws must be translated into the official languages. However, only the French version has legal force.
                    <br>³ Dörtstan is an Esperantist state, which considers Esperanto to be on the same level as the official languages. However, its standardized form is not set by the Language State Council, but by the UEA.
                    <br>⁴ The languages standardized by the Language State Council must be understood by the extreme majority of Speakers, who must make up the majority of the population, to allow them access to the State and its institutions. The State must promote all official languages through education. Standardized languages must be chosen to allow maximum comprehension by the population.
                    <br>⁵ Language must be considered a cultural element, and thus an important part of international power. A thoughtful language policy is therefore necessary for global power.</P>
